- Hi, I'm Adia Cruz
- I'm interested in art, music, and books
- I'm currently learning more about the world of coding
- I'm originally from the island of Guam
- I'm a Sophomore in Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because I was interested in seeing how to build codes to make functioning products
- A fun fact about me is: It took me 20 years to like fish!
- What do I want to learn from EE205? I want to learn and understand new coding languages
- A book or movie I'd reccomend is: Everything, Everywhere, All at Once
